A collection of generative art pieces created in [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

### circle-packing
Generates circles with random positions, colors, and sizes, making sure that two circles never overlap. Circles avoid other circlular target areas that are generated initially (iter1) or move in a circular pattern over time and clear circles that intersect their path (iter2).
